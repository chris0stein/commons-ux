                    You have successfully created your account! Before you can begin using your account, you will need to activate your account by clicking on the link in the email we just sent to you. This extra step helps to ensure phony accounts are not created.
                </p>
                
                <p>If, for some reason, you do not receive the activation email within 24 hours, please check your junk/spam folder as it is very common to have email delivery problems because of automated filters.</p>
                <p>If you don't find the email then <a href="#">contact us</a> and we'll get back to you a soon as possible.</p>
